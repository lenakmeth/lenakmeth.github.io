_First things first, a quick guide on  [how to pronounce my name](/pronounce/)._

**Studies**  

I am a  **PhD student**  under the auspice of  [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/)  in two teams:  [CLLE](https://clle.univ-tlse2.fr/)  at University of Toulouse II-Jean Jaurès, and  [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/)  at University of Toulouse III-Paul Sabatier University. My advisors are  [Dr. Nabil Hathout](http://www.timvandecruys.be/)  and  [Dr. Tim Van de Cruys](http://www.timvandecruys.be/)  respectively. My research focuses on distributional semantics, on how pretrained models are able (or not) to capture subcategorization frames.  
Previously, I finished my  **MSc**  at Saarland University, in the Language Science and Technology Master's program. I finished my undergraduate studies in the University of Patras, with a  **B.A.**  in Greek Philology, Major in Linguistics. Check out my  [Publications](/publications.html)!

**Work**  

I previously worked at the  [Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Kunstliche Intelligenz](http://dfki.de)  (DFKI), in the Multilingual Techologies lab, under Prof. Dr.  [Günter Neumann](http://dfki.de/~neumann/), on multilingual text classification, syntactic parsing, dictionary generation and automatic linguistic annotation.

**Misc**  

My pronouns are  [she/her](http://pronoun.is/she). I make chatbots in Perl, I fence, and I am the designated baker at my workplaces. My natural habitat is art museums, and I have  [strong](static/images/ongo-gablogian.gif)  opinions about Paul Gauguin. I love Belgium, writing, and Oxford commas. I am a  [mutant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinodactyly).
