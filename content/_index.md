_First things first, a quick guide on  [how to pronounce my name](/pronounce/)._

I'm currently at the cross-section of my PhD deliberation and the start of my post-doctoral research. For any questions, don't hesitate to send me an email or reach out on Mastodon!


**Studies**  


I was (technically, am) a **PhD student**  under the auspice of [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/) in two teams: [CLLE](https://clle.univ-tlse2.fr/)  at University of Toulouse II-Jean Jaurès, and  [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/) at University of Toulouse III-Paul Sabatier University. My advisors are  [Nabil Hathout](http://www.timvandecruys.be/) and  [Tim Van de Cruys](http://www.timvandecruys.be/). 
My doctoral research research focused on LLM explainability through the eyes of a linguist; can contextual word embeddings capture essential, complex and interesting linguistic knowledge? They learn many contexts, but can they deduce fine-grained preferences and constraints? Can they deal with "simple" concepts such as word order and "difficult" concepts such as time?
_(Stay tuned for the thesis defense date!)_ 


I pursued my **MSc**  at Saarland University, in the Language Science and Technology Master's program. 


I pursued my undergraduate studies in the University of Patras, with a  **B.A.** in Greek Philology, Major in Linguistics. 

**Work**  

I am currently working with [Chloé Braud](https://www.irit.fr/~Chloe.Braud/) and [Philippe Muller](https://www.irit.fr/~Philippe.Muller/) at [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/) on mulilingual discourse relation extraction/identification.


I previously worked at the  [Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Kunstliche Intelligenz](http://dfki.de) (DFKI), in the Multilingual Techologies lab, under Prof. Dr.  [Günter Neumann](http://dfki.de/~neumann/), on multilingual text classification, syntactic parsing, dictionary generation and automatic linguistic annotation.

**Misc**  

My pronouns are  [she/her](http://pronoun.is/she). I fence (fleuret, lightsaber), but my favorite contact sport is drag. I am the designated baker at my workplaces. My natural habitat is art museums, and I have  [strong](/images/ongo-gablogian.gif) opinions about Paul Gauguin. I love Belgium, writing, and Oxford commas. I am a [mutant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinodactyly).
