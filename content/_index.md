_First things first, a quick guide on  [how to pronounce my name](/pronounce/)._

I am a psot-doctoral researcher located in Toulouse, France. I am currently working with [Chloé Braud](https://www.irit.fr/~Chloe.Braud/) and [Philippe Muller](https://www.irit.fr/~Philippe.Muller/) at [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/) on mulilingual discourse relation extraction/identification. For any questions, don't hesitate to send me an email or reach out on Mastodon!


**Studies**  


I finished my **PhD** under the auspice of [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/) in two teams: [CLLE](https://clle.univ-tlse2.fr/)  at University of Toulouse II-Jean Jaurès, and  [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/) at University of Toulouse III-Paul Sabatier University. My advisors are  [Nabil Hathout](http://www.timvandecruys.be/) and  [Tim Van de Cruys](http://www.timvandecruys.be/). 
The title of my thesis is: _"What do you know, BERT? Exploring the linguistic competencies of Transformer-based contextual word embeddings"_ and can be found [here](https://www.theses.fr/s235951).
My doctoral research focused on LLM explainability through the eyes of a linguist; can contextual word embeddings capture essential, complex and interesting linguistic knowledge? They learn many contexts, but can they deduce fine-grained preferences and constraints? Can they deal with "simple" concepts such as word order and "difficult" concepts such as time?


I pursued my **MSc**  at Saarland University, in the Language Science and Technology Master's program. I pursued my undergraduate studies in the University of Patras, with a  **B.A.** in Greek Philology, Major in Linguistics. 


**Work**  


I previously worked at the  [Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Kunstliche Intelligenz](http://dfki.de) (DFKI), in the Multilingual Techologies lab, under Prof. Dr. [Günter Neumann](http://dfki.de/~neumann/), on multilingual text classification, syntactic parsing, dictionary generation and automatic linguistic annotation.
